# Pubster for Atom
[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-crayons.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

A classy dark syntax theme inspired by Tubster and all its variants.

Both `language-gfm` and `language-markdown` have been tuned for the best possible
appearance, however they will not look exactly the same.

Credit to whoever made Tubster in the first place.

- Supports CriticMarkup
- Hue rotation for embedded JS/CoffeeScript/CSS
- Text Decoration for markdown: **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethrough~~
