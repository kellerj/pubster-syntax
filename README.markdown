# Pubster for Atom
[![apm](https://img.shields.io/apm/v/pubster-syntax.svg?style=flat-square)](https://atom.io/packages/pubster-syntax)

A classy dark syntax theme inspired by Tubster and all its variants.

Both `language-gfm` and `language-markdown` have been tuned for the best possible
appearance, however they will not look exactly the same.

Credit to whoever made Tubster in the first place.

- Supports CriticMarkup
- Text Decoration for markdown: **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethrough~~
- Tuned to be contrast safe to the WCAG AA standard. This means better readability!
